    Effect System
</h1>
<hr />
<h2 class="logoed">
    Overview
</h2>
    Concur's effect system is a modified form of FRP termed EDFRP. In EDFRP, every value that
    changes over time is represented as a function from time to values, and every side-effect
    is represented as a value. A program in Concur is essentially a function from time to
    effects, or "effects over time". Effects can be sequenced or run concurrently depending
    on how the effect values are ultimately combined.

    Signals
</h2>
    In Concur, Signals are the generic term for any function from a time to a value. That is:
    <br /> <code>(Signal A) ~ (-&gt; Time A)</code><br />
    Signals can be used to model any input that changes over time. For instance, <br />
    <br /> <code>randomBit :: Time -&gt; Bool</code> <br />
    could represent a function that returns a different random Boolean value depending on
    what time it's evaluated at. This is the same as <br />
    <code> randomBit :: Signal Bool </code> <br />
    It is possible to manually define signal functions.

    Main

<pre>
globref (WindowHandle mainwindow)
def (effect main) (time t)
    seq
        init    
        forever
            display currenttime

def (effect init) 
    Qt.createWindow(640,480, mainwindow) //creates window of 640 by 480 and loads globref with it

def (effect display) (int todisplay)
    seq
        Qt.drawtext(0,0,todisplay.toString,mainwindow)
        Qt.refresh(30)
def (effect forever) (listof(either(-&gt; time effect, effect)) etc)
    seq
        seq etc
        forever
def (effect seq) (listof(either(-&gt; time effect, effect)) etc) (time t)
</pre>

<h2>
    Model
</h2>
    In Concur, values that vary over time are represented with functions of the form
    (time -&gt; value). Every external, real-world input in Concur is represented as 
    a function of this form, termed a signal. When provided a time, a signal will return
    a value that may be used in other computations. Since all functions in Concur are
    referentially transparent, the same signal evaluated at the same time will always
    return the same value. This is a very important aspect of signals that must be preserved.
