    Evaluation
</h1>
<hr />
<h2 class="logoed">Overview</h2>
    Concur is unlike most languages in that evaluation is required to simulate parallel
    evaluation of all arguments to functions and the bodies of functions. This comes as
    a result of Concur using lazy-future evaluation. Any implementation of Concur is
    required to at least implement lazy evaluation or any form of evaluation with the same
    semantics as lazy evaluation. However, the semantics of constructs in Concur are 
    required to have the same behavior under lazy evaluation and lazy-future evaluation.
    In addition, at the time of writing, it is recommended for implementations to experiment
    with lazy-future evaluation, where applicable. Given the correct architecture, it may
    be possible to take advantage of implicit parallelism wherever it appears.
<h2 class=logoed">Lazy Evaluation</h2>
    Under lazy evaluation, a function application is evaluated by binding all of the
    expressions for arguments to the parameters as "thunks", or expressions yet to be
    evaluated. Once these thunks are bound, execution continues from inside the body of
    the function. This process continues until a function is encountered that is either a
    primitive or a function with strictness annotations, in which case the arguments are
    evaluated immediately under "strict" evaluation. Lazy evaluation has the benefits of
    allowing the implicit construction of lazy, infinite lists and it can occasionally
    be exploited to improve the runtimes of programs without losing expressiveness. 
    However, lazy evaluation is sometimes difficult to reason about in performance
    and it is inherently sequential. However, the gains in expressiveness and the
    requirements on functional purity make lazy evaluation a good choice for a functional
    language like Concur. Concur implementations are required to implement lazy evaluation
    at a minimum.
<h2 class=logoed">Lazy Future Evaluation</h2>
    Lazy future evaluation is like lazy evaluation, but instead of each argument being
    bound into a thunk that is evaluated only when needed, each argument to every function
    is bound to a separate thread of execution, and the parameters inside the body of the
    function are bound to something that references the correct thread of execution. These
    threads may be garbage-collected at will, with the primary thread being the root node.
    When a function is encountered [a foreign function or a primitive] that requires its
    arguments to be evaluated before proceeding, the thread of execution evaluating
    the function application must wait until all of the threads computing the arguments
    have completed and returned results to continue. <br />
    Lazy future evaluation exploits implicit parallelism incredibly well. However, due to
    the large number of threads created and blocked, performance is a concern. 
    The recommendation is to combine lazy future evaluation with lazy evaluation by
    switching to lazy evaluation in each thread when no gains are to be made by lazy
    future evaluation. [This strategy is easier in an interpreter or a JIT compiler, but
    it may be possible in a compiler, but this is pure speculation. Research must
    be done in the area.]
