    Syntax
</h1>
<hr />
<h2 class="logoed">
    Overview
</h2>
        Concur has some roots in LISP, and as such, every program is represented as S-Expressions.
        However, the "excessive" parentheses and the "foreign" nature of prefix notation deter
        many programmers away from LISP and variants. Concur solves both of these problems, and
        also makes the syntax more familiar to users of other languages through the use of a
        minimal set of transformations from what are called "syntatic forms" to S-Exprs. These 
        transformations support C/Python/Java/whatever style functions, "block" indentation,
        line completions, "object member/method" syntax, and a limited form of infix notation
        to add to standard S-expressions. The addition of syntatic forms makes Concur easy
        to read when they are used idiomatically. 
<h2 class="logoed">
    S-Expressions
</h2>
        S-Expressions are the basic underlying representation of code in Concur. S-Expressions
        are basically lists enclosed in parentheses where each element is separated by whitespace.
        Ex:
        <code>(1 2 3 4 5)</code>
        In an S-Expression, if the first element is a function, then the following items of the
        list will be passed as arguments to the function. 
        <code>(<var>function</var> <var>arg<sub>1</sub></var> <var>arg<sub>2</sub></var> ...)</code>
        S-Expressions require that functions be the first element of a list to be evaluated --
        <code>(2 + 2)</code> is not the same as 4, it is only the same as <code>(2 + 2)</code>
        You would need to type <code>(+ 2 2)</code> to get the correct result. 
<h2 class="logoed">
    Comments
</h2>
        Comments in Concur come in two forms -- block comments <code>/* This is a comment */</code>
         and line comments. <br /><code>//This is also a comment</code>
          <br />At the present moment, nested comments and
         docstrings are not specified by the Concur Language Spec. 
<h2 class="logoed">
    Identifiers
</h2>
        Identifiers consist of any string of valid characters. Valid characters for identifiers
        include everything with the exceptions of 
        <pre><code>  "  (  )  {  }  [  ]  . , </code></pre>, and 0-9 cannot be used for the first
        character in an identifier. Identifiers are also required to be case-insensitive for
        the first character.
        Identifiers are used to express parameter names, type names, and function names. 
<h2 class="logoed">
    Literals
</h2>
    <h3>
        String Literals
    </h3>
            Strings consist of an opening set of quotes  "  and some text closed by  ". 
            At the current moment, this specification leaves nested quotation up to
            determination by implementation -- after an implementation exists it should
            be swiftly integrated into the language standard.
    <h3>
        Integer Literals
    </h3>
            An integer literal consists of any contiguous sequence of numerals that does not
            classify as part of a floating-point literal or a arbitrary-precision literal.
            Examples: <code> 1 2 3 </code>
    <h3>
        Floating-Point Literals
    </h3>
            Floating-point literals consist of a contigous sequence of numerals, optionally
            followed by a dot and another sequence of numerals, terminated by the suffix "f".
            Examples: <code>1.0f 30000.0001f</code>
    <h3>
        Arbitrary-Precision Literals
    </h3>
            Arbitrary-precision literals are the same as floating-point literals, but without
            the "f" suffix. Examples: <code> 1.0  2.3  3.1415926535 </code>
    <h3>
        Imaginary Literals
    </h3>
            Imaginary literals consist of any of the above literals with an "i" appended to the
            end. Examples: <code> 1.0i  1.0fi  3i </code> Example of a complex number:
            <code>(5.0 + 1.0i)</code>
    <h3>
        Binary Literals
    </h3>
            Binary literals consist of a sequence of 1's and 0's terminated by "b". 
            They are automatically cast into the appropriate structural type [See "Type System"]
            Example: <code> 10111001b </code>
<h2 class="logoed">
    Syntatic Forms
</h2>
    Syntatic forms allow Concur to be more expressive in syntax. They are translated to 
    S-expressions, and the following sections will provide a visual demonstration of the
    translation followed by a technical description and an example. These transformations 
    can be applied in any order, except for where noted. In the following sections, 
    optional parameters and syntatic components are surrounded by []'s.
    <h3>
        "Function Call" Form
    </h3>
            <code>f(a,b c,d)</code> <code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code> 
            <code>(f a (b c) d)</code> <br />
            <code><var>function</var>(<var>arg<sub>1<sub>1</sub></sub></var> 
            [<var>arg<sub>1<sub>2</sub></sub></var> [...]]
            [, <var>arg<sub>2<sub>1</sub></sub></var> ...]
            )</code>
            <br /><br />
            A "Funcall" form consists of a valid identifier for a function followed by
            an opening paren, followed by either a parameter or a space-separated list that
            will function as the first argument, optionally followed by a comma and more
            arguments in this format delimited by commas. If a space-separated list is used
            instead of a single parameter, the space-separated list becomes a nested list
            that is placed into the correct position for the argument. Otherwise, the
            parameter is simply placed in the correct position for the argument. <br /><br />
            Examples of this transformation:
            <br /><br />
            <code>print(lowerToUpper "hi")  </code> <code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code> 
            <code>  (print (lowerToUpper "hi"))</code> <br />
            <code>map(+ 3, 1 2 3 4 5 6)  </code> <code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code>
            <code>  (map (+ 3) (1 2 3 4 5 6))</code> <br />
            <code>pow(2,3)  </code> <code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code> <code>  (pow 2 3)</code>
    <h3>
        "Object Member/Method" Forms
    </h3>
        While Concur is NOT an Object-Oriented language by design, Concur does have
        structs and polymorphism, which effectively capture the functionality of OOP.
        Whenever you are accessing members of a struct using accessor functions or
        are using functions that would make sense as methods in other languages,
        these forms are a good choice.
        <h4>
            Object Member Form
        </h4>
            <code>x.y.z </code><code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code> <code> (z (y x))</code><br />
            <code><var>object</var>.<var>member<sub>1</sub></var>[. ...]</code><br /><br />
            This form consists of an object [any valid identifier <b>or literal</b>]
            followed by a dot, followed by a member [any valid identifier], optionally
            followed by more dot-separated members. Since members of structs [primary use]
            are actually functions that take a struct and return the value of the member,
            this notation gives the correct behavior since the last member accessor becomes the
            outermost function, and the process is repeated until the root object is reached
            . <br /><br />

            Examples of this transformation: <br /><br />
            <code>player.position.x </code><code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code> 
            <code>(x player.position)</code> <code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code>
            <code> (x (position player))</code><br />
            <code>"Hello World!".length </code><code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code> 
            <code> (length "Hello World!)</code>
        <h4>
            Object Method Form
        </h4>
            <code>x.y.f(a b,c) </code> <code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code> <code> ((f (a b) c)(y x))</code> <br />
            <code><var>object</var>[.<var>member<sub>1</sub></var> ...].<var>funcall</var> </code>
            Where "funcall" is something that is valid in "Function Call" syntax.<br /><br />
            
            Object method syntax is effectively a combination of object member syntax and
            function call syntax. This is not an additional rule per se, it's simply an
            emergent result of the precedence of the function call transformation over
            the object method transformation. For a visual [each successive line is
            equivalent]:<br /><br />

            <code>x.y.f(a,b)</code><br />
            <code>x.y.(f a b) //Yes, perfectly valid!</code><br />
            <code>((f a b) x.y)</code><br />
            <code>((f a b) (y x))</code><br /><br />

            Examples: <br /><br />
            <code>player.resolveCollisionWith(projectile) </code><code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code>
            <code> ((resolveCollisionWith projectile) player)</code><br /><br />
            <code>icon.displaybox.setDims(double size, size) 
            </code><code class="smallarrow"> &#8594; </code>
            <code> ((setDims (double size) size) (displaybox icon))</code>
    <h3>
        "Indented Block" Form
    </h3>
        <table  >
        <tr>
            <td>
<pre>
<var>f</var> <var>a</var> <var>b</var>
    c
    d
</pre>
            </td>
            <td>
                <pre class="arrow"> &#8658; </pre>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>(f (a b) c d)</code>
        </tr>
        </table>
<pre>
<var>function</var> [<var>arg<sub>1<sub>1</sub></sub></var> ...]
    <var>arg<sub>1 [or 2]<sub>1</sub></sub></var> [...]
    [<var>arg<sub>2 [or 3]<sub>1</sub></sub></var> [...]]
    [...]
</pre>
        <br />
        Indented blocks consist of a function followed by a space-separated list of
        components of the first argument, followed by indented sequences of space-separated
        components of additional arguments. "indented" is defined as either the addition of
        a tab character or more than two spaces from the beginning of a block. An indentation
        level is required to be consistent -- no mixing tabs and spaces for the same level!
        All other transformations take precedence over this one, and innermost blocks take
        precedence over outermost blocks..<br />
        Examples of this transformation: <br />
<table  >
<tr>
    <td>
<pre>
def (int fac) (int n)
    if n = 0
       1
       n * fac(n - 1)
</pre>
    </td>
    <td>
        <pre class="arrow">&#8658;</pre>
    </td>
    <td>
        <pre>(def ((int fac) (int n)) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fac (- n 1)))))</pre>
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>
<pre>
letref a 0
    do
        while (a != 1000)
            print a
            mutateref a (+ 1)
</pre>
    </td>
    <td>
        <pre class="arrow"> &#8658; </pre>
    </td>
    <td>
       <pre> (letref (a 0) (do (while (!= a 1000) (print a) (mutateref a (+ 1)))))</pre>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>
        Note that the above examples are a great improvement in readability over their
        S-Expression equivalents. -- The first example only uses 3 pairs of parens under 
        Concur's syntax, but the S-expression equivalent uses 9 pairs of parens. The second
        example is 2 vs. 8. In addition to reducing parens, indentation syntax standardizes
        an indentation style, which further improves readability of programs.
    <h3>
        "Line Fold" Form
    </h3>
        This form basically says that any opening paren that is not completed by the end
        of a line defines an S-expression that continues until the ending paren -- that is,
        all the way up to the line the end is on, the line continues "logically". 
        This allows arguments in function definitions to be on multiple lines in addition
        to allowing traditional-style S-expressions with traditional-style indentation.
        The feature of allowing traditional-style S-expressions can be used by recovering
        LISP programmers while they get used to Concur, but they are not idiomatic
        and should eventually be converted to more idiomatic syntax using the syntatic forms
        correctly. Line folds take precedence over blocks.<br /><br />
        Examples:<br /><br />
<pre>
def ((effect draw) (image img)
     (vector2D pos) (vector2D dimensions))
    ...

(def (double-arg f x)
    (f x x)
)
</pre>

    Transformations on the AST
</h2>
    In addition to the above syntatic elements and transformations, two transformations
    take place at the level of the AST: Reordering and singleton elimination. 
    <h3>
        Reordering
    </h3>
        <code>(a f b)</code> <code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code> <code>(f a b)</code> <br />
        Where f is a function and a is NOT a function.

        Basically, the reordering transform means that the first item that has the type
        signature of a function in a S-expression is reordered to be the first item of 
        the S-expression. In addition, this transformation applies to parametric types
        and types. [with parametric types taking the role of functions]. This allows a
        limited form of infix notation, and makes it possible to write (2 + 2) or
        (a &#8594; b) or (b and c) ... etc. This solves the problem of the "foreign-ness"
        of prefix notation, but it avoids adding the complexity of precedence-levels
        to the parser and to the user. It does force the programmer to
        explicitly specify the order of operations with parentheses and syntatic forms,
        however, this is a good thing.
    <h3>
        Singleton Elimination
    </h3>
        <code>((x) y)</code><code class="smallarrow">&#8594;</code> <code>(x y)</code> <br /><br />
        This transformation eliminates any singleton lists. If you want a singleton list
        for some reason or another, you need to explicitly construct one with
        singleton(x).
