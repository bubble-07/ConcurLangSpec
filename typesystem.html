    Type System 
</h1>
<hr />
<h2 class="logoed">
    Overview
</h2>
    Concur's type system provides for an interesting hybrid of static type-checking and dynamic typing. Exact type inference for Concur's type system is [with all likelihood] undecidable, so Concur instead has a well-defined limit to what types can be inferred, and it provides two levels of type-safety, "Non-Strict", and "Strict". This approach allows the flexibility of typing in a dynamic language, while still rejecting a large subset of poorly-typed programs. Concur's type system provides subtyping, ad-hoc polymorphism, parametric types and type variables.

<h2 class="logoed">
    Subtyping
</h2>
    A type <var>B</var> in Concur may be related to a type <var>C</var> in Concur by the
    relations of subtyping and supertyping. 
    If <var>A</var> is a subtype of <var>B</var>, then it implies that for every location in the program
    where <var>B</var> is demanded, <var>A</var> is accepted, as well. For example, 
    wherever a <code>Num</code> is required as an argument to a function
    , an <code>Int</code> may be passed instead. Unlike many Object-Oriented
    languages, Concur does not restrict subtyping to a strict tree [or forest]
    structure --
    instead, subtyping in Concur forms a directed graph of relations between types.
    For example: <br />
    <object width="512px" height="256px" data="graphs/exgraph.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
    </object> 
    <object width="256px" height="256px" data="graphs/diamond.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
    </object> <br /> 
    In the above diagrams, arrows lead from supertypes to subtypes. <br /> <br />
    Concur has a type called "Any" that is the subtype of no types, but is the
    supertype of all types. A function parameter typed as "Any" may be of any type.
    It is similar in function to "Object" in other languages. Every new type
    automatically subtypes Any. <br /><br />
    You may notice that in the first diagram, Int and Integer are subtypes of each
    other. Any directed cycle of types in Concur implies that all types connected
    are actually the same type, but with different names. The same goes for Bool
    and Boolean -- they both describe the same type [since all functions that
    accept Bool must also accept Boolean and vice-versa].<br />
    <h3>Rules of Subtyping</h3>
    Note: A &sub; B implies that A subtypes B, A = B implies that A and B are equal,
    A &ne; B implies inequality, and A &lt; &gt; B implies that A and B are disjoint.
    <br /> <br />
    <pre>
A &sub; B   AND   B &sub; C    &#8594;    A &sub; C


A &sub; B   AND   B &sub; A    &#8594;    A = B

Corollary: A = B    &#8594;    A &sub; B  AND  B &sub; A


A = B   AND   B = C    &#8594;    A = C

A = B    &#8594;    B = A

NOT (A = B)    &#8594;    A &ne; B

NOT (A &sub; B  OR  B &sub; A)    &#8594;    A &lt; &gt; B
</pre>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
These are all declarations that can inhabit a namespace
<h4>Declaration</h4>
<code>type <var>A</var></code> <br /> <br />
Declares that <var>A</var> is a type. Not strictly necessary if implicitly
declared using the below declarations. All declarations of types in Concur
are tied to namespaces, and the same scoping rules for function definitions
apply for types. 
<h4>Subtyping</h4>
<code><var>A</var> subtypes <var>B</var></code> <br />
<code><var>A</var> subs <var>B</var></code> <br />
<code><var>A</var> &lt;: <var>B</var></code> <br />
<br />
For example, the earlier diamond-shaped graph could be represented as: <br />
<code>Button &lt;: Rectangle <br />
Button &lt;: Clickable </code><br />
<h4>Supertyping</h4>
<code><var>A</var> supertypes <var>B</var> </code> <br />
<code><var>A</var> sups <var>B</var> </code> <br />
<code><var>A</var> :&gt; <var>B</var> </code> <br /> <br />
Example: <br />
<code>Number :&gt; Integer </code> 
<h4>Type Equality</h4>
<code>typedef <var>A</var> <var>B</var> </code> <br /> <br />
Example: <br />
<code>typedef Int Integer</code>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
    Concur actually specifies two different levels of type-strictness.
    The first level only rejects programs that "cannot possibly be" typed
    correctly, and the second level rejects any program that cannot be
    proved to be typed correctly at compile-time. Implementations are
    required to provide both levels of strictness.
    <h4>Non-Strict Concur</h4>
    In Non-Strict Concur, a typing error arises iff a function's accepted
    argument type is disjoint from the recieved argument's type. This enforces
    that programs that are "obviously typed incorrectly" are rejected by
    the type-checker -- for example, a function typed as requiring a Bool
    for its first argument cannot be passed something that is definitely
    an Int [at compile-time], or a type error will be raised [at compile-time].
    However, something requiring a Bool may accept an "Any" in non-strict mode,
    because at compile-time, it is impossible to determine whether the contents
    of the argument provided are actually a Bool or something else. At run-time,
    when the argument is actually evaluated, a type-error will arise if the
    argument turns out to not be a Bool. 
    <h4>Strict Concur</h4>
    Strict Concur is preferred over Non-Strict Concur. In Strict Concur, a
    compile-time type error arises wherever a function requires an argument
    of type <var>A</var>, but the provided argument <var>B</var> cannot be
    proven to be a subtype of A. The requirements of the method for
    proving subtyping are provided in a later section. Under the Strict
    variant, a function accepting an Int cannot be provided an argument typed
    as "Any". Run-time type errors are still possible in Strict Concur, but
    they have to be explicitly defined by the user [see below]. 
    Everything within the Standard Library of Concur MUST work in
    Strict mode. 
<h2 class="logoed">Parametric Types</h2>
    A parametric type is a type that accepts a type as a parameter. That statement
    is actually inaccurate, as the parametric type by itself means nothing, unless
    all of the parameters that it accepts are filled. An example of a parametric
    type would be a list of elements of some defined type, or
    <code>listof <var>A</var></code>, where <var>A</var> is the type of all of the
    elements. Just like regular types, parametric types can subtype and supertype
    other types. For example: <br /><br />
    <code> typedef (listof Any) list </code><br /><br />
    Parametric types, when used in compound type expressions or as parameters to
    other parametric types, must be surrounded in parentheses to ensure proper
    semantics. Parametric types are re-ordered to the first element of a S-expression,
    just like functions. <br />
    Parametric types can be declared using "type", but with the name of the parametric
    type coming first, followed by the domain that each parameter can take on. <br /><br />
    Examples: <br /> <br />
    <code>type Complex Number</code> <br />
    <code>type Dict Hashable Any </code> <br /> <br />
    It is a type error if a parametric type is instantiated with parameters outside of
    the specified domains,
    and this may be determined at compile-time or run-time, depending on the strictness
    level. <br />
<h2 class="logoed">Type Variables</h2>
    <h3>In subtyping relations</h3>
    Type variables are "placeholders" for a type. A type variable may be any
    valid identifier that is not already used as a type or as a function.
    Type variables are useful for specifying universal relations between types.
    <br /><br />For example: <br />
    <br /><code>Any :&gt; A</code> <br />for all A. <br /><br />
    In Concur, the "for all" is implied,
    so the previous code is actually entirely accurate. In addition, with a type
    variable, it is possible to quantify subtyping relations of parametric types.
    For example: <br /><br />
    <code>Termin A &lt;: A</code><br /><br />
    "Termin" is a parametric type that expresses "provable termination" --
    Since values in Concur are actually computations 
    [See <a href="evaluation.html">Evaluation</a>], it is possible to give
    a value a type parameterized with "Termin" to express that the computation
    can be proven to terminate. "Termin" does not claim to capture all terminating
    computations, as that would solve the halting problem -- instead, it is a
    convenience type that allows programmers to partially reason about termination,
    and it could potentially help a compiler/interpreter make smarter decisions about
    code. To understand the above declaration, try substituting "Int" for "A". <br />
    <br /><code>Termin Int &lt;: Int</code><br /><br />
    This reads as "wherever an Int is accepted, a Termin Int is accepted as well".
    However, the relation does not go the other way by design -- if a terminating
    computation that returns an Int is required, it is required, and a type error
    will be yielded if one is not provided.  
    <h4>Rules</h4>
    As of v1.0, it is illegal to provide anything other than a type variable
    to a parametric type in a subtyping relation [for the sake of simplicity] -- the subtyping
    constraint must be the same across the entire domain of the parameter. <br />
    Example: <br />
    <code>Either A B :&gt; A</code><br />
    <code>Either A B :&gt; B</code><br /> <br />
    The above parametric type would express the type of 
    something that could be of either type A or of type B
    -- for example, "Either Num String" means both <code>Either Num String :&gt; Num</code> and
    <code>Either Num String :&gt; String</code>. However, these are not valid as subtyping
    relations by themselves -- being able to express arbitrary exceptions for specific types
    provided to parametric types would make the type system quickly grow complicated, so for now,
    parametric types always need type variables as parameters in subtyping relations. 

    <h3>In function definitions</h3>
    Type variables may also appear in function definitions. For example, let's say we want to
    define the identity function in Concur. The simple way to do this would be: <br />
<pre>def identity x
    x</pre> <br />
    How would we express the type of this function? Functions in Concur from type <var>A</var>
    to type <var>B</var> are expressed by <code><var>A</var> -&gt; <var>B</var></code> .
    Since the identity function simply returns its argument, its type must be 
    <code>A -&gt; A</code>. If we want to explicitly state this in the function definition,
    we can say: <br />
<pre>def (A identity) (A x)
    x</pre> <br /> Provided that A is a valid type variable, the above will work as intended.
    Using type variables, we can express parametric polymorphism. Another example would be
    <code>map :: (A -&gt; B) -&gt; (collectionof(A) -&gt; collectionof(B))</code>, where "::"
    reads as "is typed as".
    (this is actually a function of two arguments. See currying.)
    <h4>Note of caution</h4>
    The above example of the identity function is very contrived
    -- it would be much better in this case to simply
    let type inference and/or dynamic typing to do its work. In general, annotate types
    when you want to impose a restriction on an operation, to document
    a complicated type, or allow expression of...
<h2 class="logoed">Ad-hoc Polymorphism</h2>
    Ad-hoc polymorphism in Concur allows a function to accept multiple different types,
    and select the function body for the correct type. This makes it possible for functions
    like "print" to be able to work properly for a wide range of types. For example, <br />
<pre>def print (float in) t
    //definition goes here

def print (int in) t
    //yet another definition

def print (string in) t
    //... and so on</pre><br />

    Ad-hoc polymorphism also allows for subtypes to mimic object-oriented inheritance-based
    polymorphism -- for example, let's say that we have: <br />
<pre>def draw (Enemy in) t
    //definition goes here</pre> <br />
    as a method to draw a generic enemy, and we want to specialize that for a new type that
    subtypes enemy, let's call it HugeEnemy. In order to change the behavior of draw for a
    HugeEnemy, all we have to do is: <br />
<pre>def draw (HugeEnemy in) t
    //definition goes here</pre> <br />
    And if we wanted Enemy's draw function to mimic a pure virtual method in other languages,
    all we have to do is change the first definition to: <br />
<pre>def draw (Enemy in) t
    notImplemented</pre> <br />
    notImplemented is of type "error", so an error will be raised if a subtype of Enemy tries
    to pass itself to draw, and a subtype-specific definition does not exist. 
    Note: In Concur, it is illegal to define the same functions with the same types twice.
    <br /> <br />
    <h3>Selection</h3>
    In general, ad-hoc polymorphic functions have their applications determined in a
    left-to-right, most-specific-to-least-specific order of precedence. Left-to-right order
    is due to the fact that every function in Concur is curried -- for example, let's say that
    you have a function <code>f</code> that has two definitions, one of which is typed as
    <code>f :: Num -&gt; (Int -&gt; Bool)</code> and the other of which is typed as
    <code>f :: Int -&gt; (Num -&gt; Bool)</code> -- If we were to supply two Ints to the
    function, the second option would be selected, because it is more specific in the
    leftmost argument. 
    <h4>Specificness</h4> 
    The notion of "specificness" can be formalized as: if we have a type
    <var>A</var> that we're supplying to a polymorphic set of functions
    annotated as <code><var>B<sub>1</sub></var>-&gt;<var>C<sub>1</sub></var> ...</code>,
    a function passes the "first round" of selection iff <var>B<sub>n</sub></var> 
    is a supertype [or same] of <var>A</var>. For the "second round", a type error is raised
    iff any of the remaining <var>B<sub>n</sub></var> are disjoint from one another. For the
    "third round", the type out of <var>B<sub>n</sub></var> that has the shortest directed
    path to <var>A</var> is selected. 
    <h3>The type of ad-hoc polymorphic functions</h3>
    Ad-hoc polymorphic functions are "glued together" with the type:<br />
    <code>type Poly function function</code> <br />
    and the rules:<br />
    <code>Poly A B &lt;: A</code><br />
    <code>Poly A B &lt;: B</code><br />
    These constraints allow higher-order polymorphic functions to work as intended. 
    For polymorphic
    functions with more than two ad-hoc definitions, nested "Poly" types may be used --
    due to the associative nature of the type, the Spec does not specify nor care 
    how the types are nested.
<hr/>
<h2 class="logoed">Structural Typing</h2>
    In addition to hierarchial types, Concur has structural types, which express the structure
    of the data of a type. Structural types have no hierarchial relations with each other,
    and it is illegal for any type to strictly subtype a structural type [but equality is
    permitted]. Regular types are normally
    associated with structural types, and subtypes inherit the structure of the supertypes
    unless the associated structural type is overriden in the subtype. 
    In addition, all regular types may be interpreted as structural types with storage of
    either their designated structural type or their subtypes' structural types. 
    <h3>Structural Type Primitives and Operations</h3>
    Concur has a fixed set of primitive structural types that are used to express the structure
    of every datatype in the language. The philosophy behind these is that while they may not
    be actually used to implement most data structures in implementation, they provide conceptual
    simplicity and firm grounding for the language, in addition to the ability to poke at
    low-level workings from a high-level language. 
    <h4>Nil</h4>
    Nil expresses the absence of data. In the absence of declarations of structure or
    subtyping relations for a given type, its associated structural type is Nil. 
    <h4>Byte</h4>
    Byte expresses an 8-bit wide sequence of binary digits. It can be used to express an ASCII
    character or any numeric integer value within the range 0-255. At a minimum, any Concur
    implementation should support the following operations on bytes [behavior is self-explanatory]
    <h5>&gt;&gt; (right shift [byte-&gt;byte])</h5>
    <h5>&lt;&lt; (left shift [byte-&gt;byte])</h5>
    <h5>+ (addition {no overflow detection} [byte-&gt;byte-&gt;byte])</h5>
    <h5>- (subtraction [byte-&gt;byte-&gt;byte])</h5>
    <h5>* (multiplication [byte-&gt;byte-&gt;byte])</h5>
    <h5>/f (division floor [byte-&gt;byte-&gt;byte])</h5>
    <h5>/c (division ceiling [byte-&gt;byte&gt;byte])</h5>
    <h5>/ (division nearest[byte-&gt;byte&gt;byte])</h5>
    <h5>xor [byte-&gt;byte&gt;byte]</h5>
    <h5>and</h5>
    <h5>or</h5>
    <h5>not [byte-&gt;byte]</h5>

    <br />
    As explained previously in "Syntax", byte literals may be expressed through syntax of
    the form "1001000b" or through the form "0x7F".

    <h4>Pair A B</h4>
    Pair is a parametric structural type that expresses "A and B" -- it is entirely up to
    implementation to how both items are stored in memory
    <h5>fst [(Pair A B) -> A]</h5>
    Returns the first element. 
    <h5>snd [(Pair A B) -> B]</h5>
    Returns the second element.
    <h5>cons [A -> B -> (Pair A B)]</h5>
    Constructs a pair of A and B. 
    <h4>FixedOf [Int] A</h4>
    FixedOf is a special structural type that accepts an integer constant, and it expresses
    contiguous storage of [Int] elements with structural type A. The restriction upon [Int]
    is that it must be a parser-readable Integer constant, and cannot be the result of
    another expression.
    <h5>item [(FixedOf [Int] A) -> Int -> A]</h5>
    Item returns the element at the given index. 
    [starting from 0 as the first item in contiguous storage],
    <h4>VarOf A</h4> 
    VarOf expresses a contiguous storage region of a variable size containing elements
    with a structural type of A.
<h2 class="logoed">Type Checking and Inference</h2>
    <h3>Extents</h3>
    Concur has two different possible levels of type strictness, "Strict", and "Non-Strict".
    Under "Non-Strict" mode, at "compile-time" [or the time before any code is run], only
    the first two "rounds" of polymorphic function selection are performed, and the third
    is left up to run-time. In "Strict" mode, all three are performed at compile-time, but
    the third comes with conservative restrictions on typeable terms to keep termination.
    <h3>Non-Strict Case</h3>
    Type inference in Concur starts from the "main" function [and there is only one -- it
    is an error to have more than one main function, or a polymorphic main function], and
    proceeds "inwards". The outermost function in the body of main then has its type checked
