    Type System 
</h1>
<hr />
<h2 class="logoed">
    Overview
</h2>
    Concur's type system expresses a blend of differing ideas, packaged to create a consistent,
    logical whole. Concur's type system is designed to make it easy for the programmer to extend
    and generalize -- subtyping, parametric polymorphism, ad-hoc polymorphism in particular
    help the programmer to develop a good model of the relations between types (not only in code,
    but also mentally.) 
<h2 class="logoed">
    Philosophy/Conceptual Differences From Other Languages
</h2>
    In general,types in Concur represent different kinds of
    possible values and computations (since values are actually computations in Concur under
    the regime of non-strict evaluation.) This differs significantly from many mainstream
    languages. For example, it may not be sensible in other languages
    to say that a "computation that can be proven to terminate" is a type, but in Concur it is.
    <br />
    Concur makes it possible to categorize different values/computations into logical
    groups, expressed by the concept of subtyping. Unlike many object-oriented languages, there
    is no concept of a "method". Types do not implement methods -- instead, values
    of types are accepted by functions, or not, depending on whether they fit with the signature
    or not. This allows functions in Concur to be more powerful than methods, and arguably more
    powerful (conceptually) than multimethods. <br />
    In addition to rejecting the notion of a "method", Concur rejects the notion of a "member"
    of a data structure, which is arguably the most radical departure from mainstream languages.
    Since values are computations, and functions allow the construction of computations,
    "members" of data structures are really just the return values of functions with specific
    names. While Concur's syntax allows the familiar "thing.member" form, this conceptual
    simplification and generalization allows a flexibility in definition and use of
    data structures that is unparalleled. 
<h2 class=logoed">
   Types
</h2>
    Types in Concur belong to two different categories: real and virtual types. Real types
    are types that will actually find expression as different kinds of values at run-time,
    and virtual types may be used to express collections of types where the collection does not
    make sense as a type itself. For example, the type "Any" in Concur expresses the type of all
    types. [That is, a function accepting an "Any" as a parameter can accept anything] It does
    not make sense to actually have a value of type "Any", so "Any" is a virtual type. On the
    other hand, it makes perfect sense to have a value of type "Bool". This distinction between
    the real and virtual types will be elaborated upon below, where it becomes clear that only
    supertypes that are real can be distinguished from their subtypes. For now, <br />
    <code>type <var>A</var></code> defines a real type with the name <var>A</var>, and <br />
    <code>virtual <var>A</var></code> defines a virtual type. Types are scoped by namespace,
    just like functions. 
<h2 class="logoed">
    Subtyping
</h2>
    In general, the relation of "subtyping" in Concur can be read as "can be accepted as a _ in
    a function". Syntactically, subtyping is a definition of one of the following three forms:
<br /><code><var>A</var> subtypes <var>B</var></code> <br />
<code><var>A</var> subs <var>B</var></code> <br />
<code><var>A</var> &lt;: <var>B</var></code> <br />
    All of the above forms are equivalent. In addition, three more forms are provided for
    convenience: <br />
<code><var>A</var> supertypes <var>B</var></code> <br />
<code><var>A</var> sups <var>B</var></code> <br />
<code><var>A</var> :&gt; <var>B</var></code> <br />
    The three forms above are equivalent to each other and to <code><var>B</var> subs
    <var>A</var></code>. <br />
    Technically, all of the forms above do not form some special "infix exception" to the
    syntax. Rather, all of the above forms behave as "type-level operators" that are subject
    to the same reordering that functions have. For example, 
<code><var>A</var> subs <var>B</var></code> <br />
is reordered to
<code>subs <var>A</var> <var>B</var></code>
, but it is more idiomatic to use an infix notation. <br /> <br />
Syntactic quibbles aside, the subtyping relation above means that <var>A</var> can be used in
any function as a substitute for any parameter with a declared type of <var>B</var>. That's all.
<h2>
    Functions
</h2>
    Okay, I lied -- there is a lot more to subtyping, even though the above description is a
    good ideological summary statement. <br />
    Recall that functions are defined using "def", of the form: <br />
<pre>
def (<var>returntype</var> <var>functionname</var>) (<var>paramtype<sub>1</sub></var> <var>paramname<sub>1</sub></var>) ...
    <var>implementation</var>
</pre>
    From now on, the partial type signatures of functions as defined with "def" will be written
    as <code>(<var>returntype</var> <var>functionname</var>) <var>paramtype<sub>1</sub></var> ...
    </code> for convenience. [Where we don't care about the return type, it will be omitted
    along with the parens around the function name.]
    Concur supports ad-hoc polymorphism -- that is, multiple definitions may exist under the
    same function, so long as different types are accepted as parameters. Then, when the
    function is used, the implementation is selected based on the types of the parameters
    passed to it, in a left-to-right, specific-to-general order of precedence. 
    That is, say there exists a <code>F Any Int</code> and a <code>F Int Int</code>. The
    implementation for the definition of F with the second type signature will be called
    if the first argument passed is "Int", because Int is a subtype of Any, and parameters
    are passed left-to-right. Concur's type checker shouldn't care what the return type is
    as a general rule. The dispatching of a function depends on the parameters passed
    and nothing more. As a consequence, it is ambiguous to define two different implementations
    of a function with the declared types of the parameters equivalent where both implementations
    exist as part of the same namespace. <br />
<h3>NotImplemented</h3>
    Another way to look at the statements made above is to say that the existence of a function
    implementation for more general types requires that the same function applies to more
    specific types [subtypes of the general types]. This insight makes functions with
    "NotImplemented", or "NOP" as the implementation body make more sense -- "NotImplemented" 
    allows a programmer to define a general operation involving a general type, leaving the 
    specifics of implementation to specific types. For example, in a GUI library, "draw" might 
    have "NOP" as the body for the implementation of signature <code>Draw Drawable</code>. 
    However, "NOP" is special -- it belongs to NO TYPE, not even Any.
    What that means is that any time
    that NOP has the potential to be the return value of a function used in a program, 
    a type error is raised. By doing this, "NOP" allows a programmer to REQUIRE implementations
    of a function that operate upon more specific parameters than the declaration with NOP,
    which accomplishes a function similar to "virtual methods" in other languages. <br />
<h3>Return types</h3>
    A function may also have a return type that is a supertype of other types -- what this
    actually means is that the return type of the function at run-time may actually be any
    type that is a subtype of the declared return type, or in the case of a real return type,
    the type itself or anything that subtypes it. Because of this distinction between return
    types declared at compile-time and and actual return types at run-time, many other languages
    with a similar subtyping mechanism are split into "statically typed" and "dynamically typed"
    camps. The line is blurred a bit in Concur -- by default, types are statically checked, with
    the requirement that all parameters passed into functions have declared types that are
    guaranteed to be subtypes of the required parameter types. However, Concur implementations
    are REQUIRED to have an option to defer such checking to runtime in any case that a passed
    parameter COULD possibly fit with the type signature of the function. [Impossible cases will
    still be rejected statically.]
<h3>Virtual/Real distinction</h3>
    As mentioned earlier, types can be either virtual or real. In reality, the only difference
    between virtual and real types in Concur is that at run-time, any value that has a virtual
    type [as declared before run-time] MUST be of a type that is a subtype of the virtual type.
    With a real type, this does not necessarily need to be true. This is very relevant for
    type inference in Concur, because a virtual type is essentially equivalent to the set of
    all of its subtypes, but a real type is equivalent to the set of all of its subtypes with
    itself as an addition. Since determining whether a type is a subtype of another is actually
    reduced to determining whether a set of types is a subset of another, a virtual type with
    only one subtype is equivalent to that subtype.

   Type Variables
</h2>
    In place of any declared parameter type for a function, a type variable may be used instead.
    A type variable can have any name that does not name a defined type, and a type variable
    will accept any type [in the trivial case]. However, the type of the leftmost 
    parameter passed to the function [in the location of a type variable] will define the
    type required for any further
    occurrences of the type variable [to the right or in the return type]. 
    For an example, consider the type of "id",
    the identity function: <code>(A id) A</code> -- since "id" is the identity function, and
    it returns whatever input it takes unchanged, its return type must match the passed parameter
    type, no matter what it is. A type variable allows the expression of this concept. 
<h2 class="logoed">
    Parametric Types
</h2>
    The example of the identity function above should seem a little contrived, because it is.
    In reality, type variables find most of their power when used in conjunction with parametric
    types.
